Written by quantaosun@gmail.com in 2021, Shanghai, China, during a 'world record' strand time due to COVID that I can't go back to my Australian university to continue my study. The ultimate goal here is to allow you to calculate the difference in free energy of binding between a pair of small molecules, as will show in the cell labelled 🙋 👀 😊😊 below, unfortunately, you have wait at least several hours before the result could be seen, as FEP is highly costly in terms of computer resources."

This notebook is to provide the academic and non-profit research community with a real solution if they want to try this new method. There are way too many so-called FEPs that take forever to learn and finish. Desmond is the fastest and most reliable one I have ever met, with GPU supported, a typical FEP could be finished with 10h, with a Tesla V100 on Google Colab, with only a subscription fee of around 70 USD per month. It is a bit expensive if you look at it from a coffee price way, but it is nothing compared to the 100,000 USD commercial FEP per year. It is guaranteed the academic version is working, For the commercial version, I have not tested it yet, you may need to adjust some of the commands, or it might be not possible if the commercial one fixes the IP address but Colab allocates us random IP every time."
